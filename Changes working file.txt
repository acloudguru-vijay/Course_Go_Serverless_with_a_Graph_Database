up to the end of Section 3
========================
So â€¦
Basically the clean up is
strip back all Node modules
sudo npm list --depth 0
npm uninstall `ls -1 node_modules | tr '/\n' ' '`
Run npm install node-gyp
Delete rm package-lock.json file for working folder and ~
Deleting ~/.node-gyp folder and
run npm install again again.
 still getting some warns, but no Fails now.

install SLS again  sudo npm install -g serverless
and anything else you need.

Another option is to use a virtual environment like 'nodeenv' to provide a clean wrapper or
maybe NVM (The Node Version Manager)
==========
Too many conflcts with Node 12.

 cleaned out as per above plus https://stackabuse.com/how-to-uninstall-node-js-from-mac-osx/
