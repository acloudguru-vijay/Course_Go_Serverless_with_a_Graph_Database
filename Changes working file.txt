========================
So â€¦
Basically the clean up is
strip back all Node modules
sudo npm list --depth 0
npm uninstall `ls -1 node_modules | tr '/\n' ' '`
Run npm install node-gyp
Delete rm package-lock.json file for working folder and ~
Deleting ~/.node-gyp folder and
run npm install again again.
 still getting some warns, but no Fails now.

Another option is to use a virtual environment like 'nodeenv' to provide a clean wrapper
